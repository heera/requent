# Laravel Requent [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/heera/requent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/heera/requent) [![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/sheikhheera/requent/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/sheikhheera/requent) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/heera/requent/blob/master/LICENSE)

An elegant, light-weight GQL (Graph Query Language) like interface for Eloquent with zero configuration. It maps a request to eloquent query and transforms the result based on query parameters. It also supports to transform the query result explicitly using user defined transformers which provides a more secured way to exchange data from a public API with minimal effort.

## <a name="installation"></a> Installation

You can simply run the following command from your terminal to install the package:

    composer require sheikhheera/requent

Or add the following line in "composer.json" file within "require" section and run `composer install` from terminal:

    "sheikhheera/requent": "1.0.*"

> If you are using version 5.5 or greater, then you are all done, no need to add service provider or alias in `config\app`. So you can simply skip the following steps because of Laravel's package auto discovery feature.


This will install the package. Now add the following entry in your `config/app.php` file inside the `providers` section:

    Requent\RequentServiceProvider::class
    
Also add the following entry in `aliases` section of your `config/app.php` file:

    'Requent' => Requent\Facade\Requent::class,

If you've done everything right then you can start using it without any configuration but you may customize it.

## <a name="how-it-works"></a> How It Works

This package will allow us to query resources through the request query string parameter. For example, if we've a `User` model and the `User` model has many posts (`Post` model) and each post has many comments (`Comment` model) then we can query the users with their posts and comments of each posts by sending a request like the followig: `http://example.com/users?fields=posts{comments}`. This is the most basic use case but it offers more. We can also select properties of each model through query string, for example, if we want to select only the emal field from the `User` model and title from `Post` and body from the `Comment` model then we can just do it by sending a request using the following `URL`:

    http://example.com/users?fields=email,posts.orderByDesc(id){title,comments{body}}

It'll be translated into something similar to following (Not literally):

```php
User::select('email')
->with(['posts' => function($query) {
    $query
    ->orderByDesc('id')
    ->select('title')
    ->with(['comments' => function($query) {
        $query->select('body');
    }])
}]);
```

## <a name="basic-example"></a> Basic Example

To use this package, we need to create some resources (Eloquent Models). For this demonstration, we'll use the same idea using User, Post and Comment models for an imaginary blog. The User model has a `hasMany` relation for posts and the Post model has a `hasMany` relation for comments. So, we need a route, which could be a resourceful route but we'll use an explicite route declaration here:

```php
Route::get('users', 'UserController@index');
```

Now, we need a controller which is just a simple controller, for example:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Requent;
use App\User;
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return Requent::resource(User::class)->get();
    }
}
```
Now, we can make a request using: `http://example.com/users?fields=email,posts{title,comments{body}}`. This will give us the expected result, which would be an array of users (only email column from `User`) with all the related posts (only title column from `Post`) and all the comments of each post (only body column from `Comment`).

If we want to load any resource with relations without selecting any properties then we can just do it using the following request: `http://example.com/users?fields=posts{comments}`. This was the most basic example but let's explore it's features.

## <a name="resource"></a> Resource
Actually, a resource is just an eloquent model, the first method we should call on the `Requent` class is `resource` which sets the primary resource we want to query on. So we can set the resource using couple of ways, for example:

```php
$resource = Requent::resource(User::class);
```

Also, we can use an object, for example:

```php
$resource = Requent::resource(new User);
```

We can also pass a `Query Builder` for example:

```php
$resource = Requent::resource(app(User::class)->where('role', 'admin'));
```

So, we can call any scope methods as well, which just returns a `Query Builder` instance. The `resource` method returns the `Requent` object so we can chain methods, for example, we can call any query executing method (including other available methods in `Requent`), for example:

```php
$result = Requent::resource(
    app(User::class)->where('role', 'admin')
)
->transformBy(UserTransformer::class)
->keyBy('users')
->get();
```

We'll walk-through all the available methods and features that `Requent` offers. Let's continue.

## <a name="methods"></a> Methods

#### Get

We've seen `get` method earlier which just returns an array of users which is:

```php
return Requent::resource(User::class)->get();
```

#### Paginated Result

At this point, we'll get an array but we can retrieve paginated result using same `get` method and in this case we, we only need to provide a query string parameter in our `URL` like the following example:

    http://example.com/users?fields=posts{comments}&paginate

Also, we can set the paginator, for example:

    http://example.com/users?fields=posts{comments}&paginate=simple
    
This will return the paginated result using `SimplePaginator` but by default it'll use `LengthAwarePaginator`.

#### Per Page

We can also tell how many pages we want to get for per page and it's just another parameter, for example:

    http://example.com/users?fields=posts{comments}&paginate=simple&per_page=5
    
If we provide `per_page=n` then we don't need to provide `&paginate` parameter unless we want to use the simple paginator instead of `default`. We can also customize these parameters, we'll check later on.

#### Paginate
Also, we can call the `paginate` method on the `Requent` directly, for example:

```php
return Requent::resource(User::class)->paginate(); // or paginate(10)
```

#### Simple Paginate

The `simplePaginate` will return paginated result using `Simple Paginator`. [Check Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/pagination).

```php
return Requent::resource(User::class)->simplePaginate(); // or simplePaginate(10)
```

#### Find

If we want to retrieve a single `user` then we can use `find` and `first` method, for example:

```php
return Requent::resource(User::class)->find($id);
```

#### First

For the first item we can call the `first` method:

```php
return Requent::resource(User::class)->first();
```

#### Fetch

These are all the available methods for executing query but there is one more method which is `fetch`. This method can return any kind of result, an collection (array), paginated result or a singlr resource. Let's see an example:

```php

// In Controller

public function fetch($id = null)
{
    return Requent::resource(User::class)->fetch($id);
}
```
To use this method we need a route like: `Route::get('users/{id?}', 'UserController@fetch')` and then we can use this single route to get all kind of results, for example:

#### Get a collection of users (Array)

```php
http://example.com/users?fields=posts{comments}
```

#### Get paginated result

```php
http://example.com/users?fields=posts{comments}&paginate=simple&per_page=5
```

#### Get a single user (Array)

```php
http://example.com/users/1?fields=posts{comments}
```

The `fetch` method will be useful if we declare explicit route other than RESTfull routes for Resource Controllers. [Check Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/controllers#resource-controllers).

> When selecting properties of a model/resource using query string, i.e: `fields=name,posts{title}`, we can select a dynamic property (getter/accessor), defined using a `getPropertyAttribute` method. Check the documentation for [Defining An Accessor](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/eloquent-mutators#defining-an-accessor).


## <a name="key-by"></a> Resource Key By

The query results for a collection is simply an array with a zero based index but if we want then we can wrap our collection in a key using `keyBy` method, for example:

```php
return Requent::resource(User::class)->keyBy('users')->get();
```

This will return a collection of users (Array) as a key value pair where the key will be `users` and the result will be the valuse of that key. We can also use a key for a single user for example:

```php
return Requent::resource(User::class)->keyBy('user')->find(1);
```

In case of `fetch` we can use something like the following:

```php
public function fetch($id = null)
{
    return Requent::resource(User::class)->keyBy($id ? 'user' : 'users')->fetch($id);
}
```

The paginated result will remain the same, by default `Laravel` wraps the collection using the `data` as key.

## <a name="transformer"></a> Data Filtering Using Transformers

>The idea of transformers is taken from [Fractal Transformer](http://fractal.thephpleague.com/transformers/) package. This looks like re-inventing the wheel but actually it's not. The main intention for building the `Requent` package was to allow an easy to use interface for fetching resource/data form a web application (non-public `API`), which allows to read data from server using any `javaScript` framework/library even without defining any transformers. Also, the `Eloquent` query is built dynamically on the run-time to load everything eagerly, while `Fractal` uses lazy loading. So, the `Requent` couldn't utilize the data transforming feature that `Fractal` offers. So, to provide the data filtering layer (for public `API`), the `Requent` needed it's own data filtering mechanism but the `Fractal` package is great and I've used it exclusively on my projects.

So far we've seen the default data transformation, which means that, a user can get any property or available relations of the resource just by asking it through the query string parameter `fields` (we can use something else other than `fields`), but there is no way to keep some data private if you are using this for a public `API`. Here, the `transformer` comes into play.

By default, the `Requent` uses a `DefaultTransformer` class to return only selected properties/relations, for example, if you send a request using a `URL` like following: `http://example.com/users?fields=email,posts{title,comments}` then it'll return only selected properties/relations. In this case, it'll return what you ask for it but you may need to define explicitly what properties/relations a user can get from a request through query parameter. For this, you can create a custom transformer where you can tell what to return. To create a trunsformer, you just need to create transformer classes by extending the `Requent\Transformer\Transformer` class. For example:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Transformers;

use Requent\Transformer\Transformer;

class UserTransformer extends Transformer
{
    public function transform($model)
    {
        return [
            'id' => $model->id,
            'name' => $model->name,
            'email' => $model->email,
        ];
    }
}
```

To use your custom transformer, all you need to pass the transformer class to the `resource` method, i.e:

```php
return Requent::resource(User::class, UserTransformer::class)->fetch($id);
```

Also you can pass the class instance:

```php
return Requent::resource(User::class, new UserTransformer)->fetch($id);
```

Also, you can set the transformer using `transformBy` method:

```php
return Requent::resource(User::class)->transformBy(UserTransformer::class)->fetch($id);
```
Also, the `transformBy` method accepts a transformer object instance:

```php
return Requent::resource(User::class)->transformBy(new UserTransformer)->fetch($id);
```

This will transform the resource using by calling the `transform` method defined in the transformer class you created. In this case, the transform mathod will called to transform the `User` model but right now, it'll not load any relations. Which means, if the `URL` is something like: `http://example.com/users?fields=posts{comments}` then only the `User` model will be transformed and the result would be something like the following:

```
[
    {
        id: 1,
        name: "Aurelio Graham",
        email: "hharvey@example.org"
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        name: "Adolfo Weissnat",
        email: "serena78@example.com",
    }
    // ...
]
```

To load any relations from the root transformer (`UserTransformer` in this case), we also need to explicitly declare a method using the same name the relation is defined in the model, so for example to load the related posts with each `User`  model we need to declare a `posts` method in our `UserTransformer` class. For example:

```php
class UserTransformer extends Transformer
{
    public function transform($model)
    {
        return [
            'id' => $model->id,
            'name' => $model->name,
            'email' => $model->email,
        ];
    }
    
    // To allow inclussion of posts
    public function posts($model)
    {
        return $this->items($model, PostTransformer::class);
    }
}
```
In this example, we've added a filtering for `Post` model and that's why a user can select the related posts with users from the `URL`, for example: `http://example.com/users?fields=posts`. without the `posts` method in `UserTransformer` a user can't read/fetch the posts relation. At this point, we are not done yet. As you can assume that, we are transforming the posts (Collection) using `items` method available in `UserTransformer` (extended from abstract Transform class) and passing another transformer (PostTransformer) to transform the collection of posts. So, we need to implement the `PostTransformer` and have to implement the `transform` method where we'll explicitly return the transformed array for each `Post` model, for example:

```php
namespace App\Http\Transformers;

use Requent\Transformer\Transformer;

class PostTransformer extends Transformer
{
    public function transform($model)
    {
        return [
            'post_id' => $model->id,
            'post_title' => $model->title,
            'post_body' => $model->body,
        ];
    }

    // User can select related user for each Post model
    public function user($model)
    {
        return $this->item($model, new UserTransformer);
    }

    // User can select related comments for each Post model
    public function comments($collection)
    {
        return $this->items($collection, new CommentTransformer);
    }
}
```

In this example, we've implemented the `transform` method for the `Post` model for response filtering so only the `id`, `title` and `body` column will be available for the `Post` model in the response and the related posts will be included only if the user selects the posts through the query string parameter in the `URL`.

In the exmple given above, we've also defined two additional methods, `user` and `comments`. Those methods are also relations of `Post` model. The `user` method is defined as a `belongsTo` relationship which simply maps the related user who published the post and the comments method loads the related comments published under the post. The `Post` model looks something like the followin:

```php
namespace App;

use App\User;
use App\Comment;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    public function user()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }

    public function comments()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);
    }
}

```

According to the setup given above, we can make a request using the following `URL` to get all the users with posts and it's related comments and user: `http://example.com/users?fields=posts{user,comments}`.

In the `PostTransformer` class we've used `item` method inside `user` method, which actually resieves a single `Eloquent` model in `$model` parameter and so we've called the `item` method from the transformer. In the comments method, we've used the `items` method because the `$collection` parameter in comments method recieves a collection of `Comment` models.

So, it's obvious that, to allow the inclussion of any relation from a resource we've to declare a method for that relation using the same name we've used to declare the relation in the `Eloquent` model and relations will be included only if the user selects/includes it within the `fields` parameter. If user selects a relation from a resource that is not exposed throught the transformer using a method, then it'll not be available in the response.

> The user defined transformers will be used to transform the data only a transformer class is passed as the second parameter in the `resource` method or by calling the `transformBy` method, otherwise, everything will be included in the result/response the user asked for (if those fields/relations are available in the corresponding model).

## <a name="raw"></a> Get Raw Result

Requent has a `raw` method which could be useful if someone doesn't want to apply any transformation, because after the transformation, the returned data is an array. So if you want to execute the query but you want to ommit the data transformation by default (selection of columns through the query string) then you can use `raw` method, for example:

```php
$result = Requent::resource(User::class)->raw()->fetch($id);
```

In this case, when you don't provide a custom transformer to transform data then the requent will transform the data using the defalt transformer. So, if you make a request using `http://example.com/users?fields=email,posts{title}`, then it should return only `email` from the `User` model and `title` from the `Post` model. 

In this case, because of `raw`, the requent will execute the query to load the resource with mentioned relations but it'll not filter the result so the original result returned by the `Eloquent` (could be a collection, paginated data or a modeld) will be returned as the result of `Requent` query.

#### Transform Raw Result

```php

use Requent;
use App\User;
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use Requent\Transformer\TransformerHelper;
use App\Http\Transformers\UserTransformer;

class HomeController extends Controller
{
    use TransformerHelper;
    
    public function index()
    {
        $result = Requent::resource(User::class)->raw()->get();
    
        return $this->transform($result, UserTransformer::class, 'users');
    }
}
```

In this example, the third parameter `users` passed to transform method is optional, which would be used as the resource key.

> The `Requent` doesn't use lazy loading, which means that, everything (relations) is eager loaded and when it comes to transformer (transform method), the quwey has been already executed and everything is loaded. So, at this point, the `transform` method will recieve a model and and if we want to load other relations that was not loaded through the query, then we can simply call the `load` method on the model before transforming it, for example:

```php
public function transform($model)
{
    if(!$model->relationLoaded('comments')) {
        $model->load('comments');
    }
    
    return [
        'post_id' => $model->id,
        'post_title' => $model->title,
        'post_body' => $model->body,
    ];
}
```

## <a name="query-clause"></a> Query Modifier Clause

When we make a request, we can add some query modifier clauses for example, `orderBy`, `orderByDesc` e.t.c. There are several clauses that `Requent` offers to use in the `URL`, those are given below:

#### orderBy

```
http://blog54.dev/1?fields=posts{user,comments.orderBy(id){user}}
```

#### orderByDesc

```
http://example.com/1?fields=posts{user,comments.orderByDesc(id){user}}
```

#### skip & take

```
http://example.com/1?fields=posts{user,comments.skip(2).take(1){user}}
```

#### offset & limit

```
http://example.com/1?fields=posts{user,comments.offset(2).limit(1){user}}
```
#### Multiple Clauses

```
http://example.com/1?fields=posts.orderBy(title).limit(3){user,comments.orderByDesc(id).skip(2).take(1){user}}
```

> When using limit/take on a relationship and loading a collection of that relation, you may get wrong result because the limit is applied only once on the query by Laravel. [An old issue here](https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/4835).

## <a name="customizations"></a> Customizations

Requent uses some base settings from a config file. By default, it'll work as it's configured but if you need to modify any of the settings then you can publish the config file from vendor to your local app config directory. To publish the config, just execute the following command from your terminal:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Requent\RequentServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

Once you publish the config file to your local `/config` directory then you can modify any settings to customize `Requent` for your need. Follwing code is taken from the config file which is documented itself.
